## Things to look out for in the project:
* The initial state is a static data of four items
* On clicking the cart icon, it opens up the cart component and add a new card to the  heading component
* The dropdown menu icon (chevron-icon) increases the count of the count of items in the basket, which in turn increases the total price
* The Done Shopping Button clears the entire cart... This is to show a state of item completion
