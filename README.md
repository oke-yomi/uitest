### Things to look out for in the project:

- The initial state is static data of four items
- On clicking the cart icon, it opens up the cart component and add a new card to the heading component
- The dropdown menu icon (chevron-icon) increases the count of the count of items in the basket, which in turn increases the total price
- The Done Shopping Button clears the entire cart... This is to show a state of item completion
